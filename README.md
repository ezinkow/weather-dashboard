## About This Project:

This was a homework assignment as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. The weather planner allows a user to enter a city, and find out the current weather and the 5-day outlook for that city.

This website was built with jQuery, HTML and CSS.

## Summary of Project:

The website is a dashboard for finding out the weather for any city a user would like to look up. When they enter a city in the search box, a new button appears for that city. By clicking on the new city button, the current weather for that city appears, along with the 5-day forecast.
